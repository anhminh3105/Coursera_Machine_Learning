Hi,

Sorry to bother you but your free backup space is 0 GB!

Are you having troubles with your backup?
Just send us an e-mail and tell us what is wrong and we will help you!

When your free backup space is 0 GB your files will not be backed up anymore.
Please hurry and use your device within the next couple of days and your files will still be securely backed up, otherwise your backed up files will get removed from our system.

It looks like it was 62 days ago you last used your Degoo device.
Not true? Please reply now and tell us and we will help you!


Best Regards
The Degoo Team
